1. [x] Create the simplest hello world CLI in Typescript, import the following libraries:

   - tj/commander.js
   - open-telemetry/opentelemetry-js

    Do not introduce any complex file structure, minimize the number of files.

2. [ ] Add the following commands:

   - generate with the arguments public-key, vanity-address-prefix, and budget-glm

    Do not introduce any complex file structure, minimize the number of files.

3. [ ] Add a argument to specify where the opentelemetry is going to store traces and logs.
