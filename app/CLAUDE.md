# Vanity Address generator - Development Guidelines

## Development Workflow

1. Begin with thorough code analysis and complete context gathering
2. Plan incremental, well-defined changes following professional development practices
3. Implement test-driven development:
   - Write failing test case first
   - Create function stub
   - Implement function to pass tests
4. Confirm approval before proceeding to next development phase
5. Document all changes with clear justification in docs.md
