**📢 Vanity address generation powered by the Golem Network**

Soon, a new project will be launched within the Golem Ecosystem. It will be focused on generating **vanity Ethereum addresses** - addresses that include a specific pattern of your choosing, like '0xDEADBEEF...' or '0x123456…'

They are not merely cosmetic: vanity addresses can signal identity, align with branding, or simply make you easier to recognize across the chain.

⚙️ Under the hood, generating these addresses requires substantial computation - it’s a game of probabilities, repeatedly generating and testing candidates until one matches. It will **use the Golem Network** to distribute and parallelize these calculations.

We’re looking forward to seeing how it will provide utility for both casual users and teams who want more control over their on-chain identity, without the overhead of running heavy computations locally.
More information soon!
