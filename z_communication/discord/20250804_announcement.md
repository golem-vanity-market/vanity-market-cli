### [vanity.market](http://vanity.market) & Golem Ecosystem Fund

Hey @everyone! We’d like to share an update on the vanity Ethereum address generator project we teased back in June. Development is already underway, with support for both CPU and GPU providers on the Golem Network. A preview version developed by Unoperate is set to go live soon on Golem’s mainnet.

**What’s a vanity address?**
A vanity address is an Ethereum Externally Owned Account (EOA) or contract address whose hexadecimal representation includes recognizable patterns or aesthetically pleasing sequences.

Think long runs of identical digits, memorable prefixes, or even leet-speak (e.g. `0x1337… ; xDEAD…BEEF`). Vanity.market is compatible with CPU providers but can also leverage GPU-accelerated key searches for orders of magnitude faster results.

**Open-source CLI**
🔗 You can try it today! The **vanity-market CLI** is fully open-source on GitHub:
https://github.com/golem-vanity-market/golem-vanity-market-cli
Check out the README for new-user setup, examples, and detailed usage instructions.

**Please note:**
This application is a work in progress and **not yet recommended** for very long patterns.

**Get ready to compute!**
Initial demand for those calculations has been secured and it will soon hit Golem Network's mainnet.

**Next stop: Golem Network’s new marketplace**
Once Golem Network’s new implementation of Marketplace goes out of beta (end of August), vanity generation tasks will migrate to it and will work only with providers that updated their versions of yagna.

That means anyone looking to get GLM tokens by running provider nodes should be ready to switch over when a new Golem marketplace is officially launched! We’ll publish a simple migration guide in the #announcements channel when the time comes.
