Hey @everyone,

Check out this interesting address composed entirely of numbers: `0x0000300624888583429501859125535772339200`!

And speaking of cool addresses, we have some exciting news! Tomorrow, August 14th, 2025, we're releasing `vanity.market` CLI v0.1.8, with many improvements!

With the `vanity.market` CLI, you can find your own long vanity addresses. For example, finding an address with an 8-character prefix on a CPU takes around 1 hour. If you switch to GPUs, you can get a prefix of at least 10 characters in a similar amount of time (though with a bigger budget). By employing more providers, you can find longer patterns even faster. You can learn more about pattern generation difficulty here: [pattern generation difficulty](https://github.com/golem-vanity-market/golem-vanity-market-cli/blob/main/PATTERN_GEN_DIFF.md).

We're constantly working on adding more supported patterns for your Ethereum wallet addresses. Join us in the #vanity-market channel.

You can run the `vanity.market` CLI on your own machine to make your digital identity stand out, or use our open-source code as a blueprint for your own Golem applications.

Stay tuned to this channel to be the first to know when the new version drops!
