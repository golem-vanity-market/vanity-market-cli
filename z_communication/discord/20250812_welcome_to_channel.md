Hey everyone - and welcome to the official channel for **vanity.market**! 👋

We're thrilled to bring this new tool to the Golem ecosystem, developed with the support of the Golem Ecosystem Fund.

### ✨ What is vanity.market?

**vanity.market** is a vanity Ethereum address generator. It allows you to create personalized, recognizable addresses with specific patterns (e.g., `0xDEADBEEF...`, `0x1337...`).

### 🚀 Powered by Golem Network

The magic behind vanity.market is the Golem Network. We leverage its decentralized computational power to perform the intensive calculations needed for address generation. This makes creating vanity addresses accessible to everyone, not just those with powerful hardware. The tool supports both CPU and GPU providers, with GPU acceleration offering orders of magnitude faster results!
