# vanity.market on Golem Network

This document outlines the communication strategy for the **vanity.market** project, a cutting-edge vanity Ethereum address generator powered by the Golem Network.

## Tone of Voice

All communication should be:

- **Technical & Enthusiastic:** We are building a powerful tool for the Ethereum ecosystem. Our language should reflect the technical sophistication of the project while conveying excitement about its potential. We're not just building a tool, we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible with decentralized computation.
- **Community-Focused:** We are part of the Golem ecosystem and should actively engage with the community, encouraging them to try the tool, contribute to the open-source CLI, and become providers on the Golem Network.

## Key Messaging Points

### What is vanity.market?

- **A vanity Ethereum address generator:** Create custom Ethereum addresses with specific patterns (e.g., `0xDEADBEEF...`, `0x1337...`).
- **Powered by Golem Network:** Leverages the decentralized computational power of the Golem Network to perform the intensive calculations required for vanity address generation. This makes it accessible to everyone, not just those with powerful hardware.
- **Supports CPU and GPU providers:** Can utilize both CPU and GPU providers on Golem, with GPU acceleration offering orders of magnitude faster results.

### Project Status & Roadmap

- **Live on Mainnet:** A preview version is already live on Golem's mainnet.
- **Open-Source CLI:** The `vanity-market-cli` is open-source and available on GitHub for anyone to try, inspect, and contribute to.
- **Migration to New Golem Marketplace:** The project will migrate to Golem Network's new marketplace implementation once it's out of beta, utilizing providers who have updated their `yagna` version.
